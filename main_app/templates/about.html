<h2>About Our Cosmic Team</h4>

<h4>Anna Reno</h4>
<p class="tab" style="color: white;">
I have always been fascinated by the universe and the mysteries it holds, and I have dedicated my life to unlocking its secrets. From a young age, I was drawn to science and mathematics, and as I grew older, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in astrophysics.
<br>
I have spent years studying the stars, galaxies, and black holes, using my knowledge of physics and mathematics to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the universe. My research focuses on dark matter and I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what we know about the cosmos.
<br>
As a woman in a male-dominated field, I am passionate about advocating for diversity and inclusion in STEM. I believe that it is essential to have a range of perspectives and experiences represented in science, and I am committed to mentoring and inspiring young women to pursue careers in astrophysics.
<br>
In addition to my research, I also enjoy sharing my passion for astronomy with the public. I participate in outreach programs, giving talks and leading workshops, and I am always eager to engage with people from all walks of life and encourage them to learn more about the universe.
<br>
In conclusion, I am a driven and dedicated astrophysicist, driven by a love of science and a passion for discovery. I am constantly exploring the frontiers of what we know about the universe, and I am committed to inspiring others to join me on this exciting journey.

<h4>Andrew Theodosopoulos</h4>
<p class="tab" style="color: white;">
Born and raised in the birthplace of Western civilization, I have always been surrounded by a rich history of science and discovery. From the ancient philosophers who first gazed at the night sky to the modern-day astronomers who are pushing the boundaries of our understanding, Greece has been at the forefront of astronomical inquiry for millennia.
<br>
I have always been drawn to the stars, and as I grew older, my fascination only deepened. I pursued my passion by studying astronomy in depth, both in Greece and abroad, and have now become a leading expert in the field. My research focuses on stellar evolution, and I am constantly seeking to expand our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the universe.
<br>
I am also deeply committed to passing on my love of astronomy to future generations. I frequently give talks and lead workshops for students, inspiring them to pursue careers in science and technology. I also collaborate with other astronomers and organizations to promote astronomical literacy and encourage public engagement with science.
<br>
In summary, I am a proud Greek astronomer, dedicated to exploring the mysteries of the universe and sharing my passion with others. The stars have always been a source of wonder and inspiration for me, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to study them for a living.

<h4>Sarven Ornekian</h4>
<p class="tab" style="color: white;">
Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the night sky and all the mysteries it holds. I have spent countless hours studying astronomy, reading about the latest discoveries, and observing the stars through my telescope.
<br>
To me, there is nothing more humbling and awe-inspiring than contemplating the vastness of our universe and the billions of stars that make it up. Each star has its own story, and I am driven to learn as much as I can about them. Whether it's through studying their light patterns, exploring the role they play in our solar system, or imagining the possibilities of life on other planets, my love for the stars knows no bounds.
<br>
In addition to my personal passion, I am also dedicated to sharing my love for astronomy with others. I frequently give talks at schools and local clubs, encouraging others to look up at the night sky and appreciate its beauty. I also volunteer at a local observatory, helping visitors understand what they are seeing and inspiring them to learn more.
<br>
In conclusion, the stars have been a constant source of wonder and inspiration in my life, and I am excited to continue exploring their secrets and sharing my passion with others.
